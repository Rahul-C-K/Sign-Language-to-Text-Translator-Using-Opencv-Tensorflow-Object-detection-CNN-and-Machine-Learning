# Sign-Language-to-Text-Translator
We have used concepts of machine learning, computer vision, object detection, and cnn (convolutional neural networks)

# Instructions
1. if you intend to create gestures or run the translator, its advisable to run firstpage.py (Main UI made using Tkinter modules) within "Main menu and creation of datasets"
2. We have trained the MNIST dataset CNN model with Tensorflow Object Detection API. 
3. The obtained accuracy of trained model is 99.3%.
  3.1 this was obtained with 20 epochs
  3.2 feel free to reduce the number of epochs to 5 or 10, accuracy may be 94-96%, which is sufficient.
  3.3 When you run the translator, make sure your background has minimal disturbances and noise.
